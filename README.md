## OVERVIEW

This game functions similarly to the native snake xenzia game, in which a snake eats a fruit and grows in size with each fruit it swallows. The snake dies if it collides with the boundary or eats any of its own body parts (which means game over).



## FEAUTURES
- **GAME MODE**

You have the option of selecting the game mode you want to play in. There are three difficulty levels: `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`, with each mode differing in snake speed.

- **BOUNDARY TOGGLE**

 You can choose whether or not to have a boundary.  The snake boundary is set to be present by default; if the toggle icon is red, the barrier is present; if you click on the toggle icon, it switches to green, indicating that the boundary has been removed, allowing the snake to pass through the borders.
 
- **SOUND TOGGLE**

 Depending on your preferences, you can turn the sound on or off. The sound is turned on by default; to turn it off, click the sound-on icon; the icon changes to a sound-off icon, and all sound effects are muted.
 
 - **HIGH SCORE**

 There is a highscore for each mode. If your score is higher than the previous high score for a particular mode, your new score will be set to be the `highscore` for that mode
